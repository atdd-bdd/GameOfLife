Started with Gherkin scenarios.

First to implement - the static.
Then the blinker
Then the toad
Finally the glider

Did the input and output routines.   Need to figure out how to capture a moving window.

Needed to change List<Cell> to Set<Cell> so a little refactoring

Last scenario - the Glider - could not capture the steps.   Will need to do so
after getting the first working

I get some failures - I need to figure out about minX, maxX, minY, and maxY
    should these be set on input?
